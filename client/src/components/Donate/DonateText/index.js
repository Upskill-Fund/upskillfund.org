        <p>
          When considering poverty in the developing world, many people feel
          deep sorrow but conclude that there is nothing we can do. The scale of
          poverty is immense and we seem powerless to stop it. Such despair is
          understandable, but the facts tell a very different story. While
          poverty is indeed extreme and widespread, it is easy to forget just
          how many people there are in the developed world, and how powerful our
          pocket change can become when pooled together. When giving to an
          effective charity, the size of your donation directly correlates with
          the number of people you are able to help. But you don’t have to be a
          millionaire to make a significant difference; even small donations
          have the potential to drastically improve an individual’s quality of
          life.
